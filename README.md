# Polymorphic malware detection using transfer learning
This is the repository for IISc E0-256 course project on Polymorphic Malware Detection using transfer learning

Please note that this is not an independent project, you need to have already have executed codes from the repositories
 - https://github.com/parag1604/malware-detection-deep
 - https://github.com/parag1604/polymorphic-worm

in order to be able to execute the files in this repo.

_________________

## Training
 - About 20 or more files are required from the polymorphic worm repo.
 - Preprocess those files using the convert_into_image file in the malware detection repo.
 - Now, add these files to training database you created for the malware detection repo (25% in train set, and 75% in validate set). 
 - Run the train_cnn_binary_transfer.ipynb file after configuration

__________________

## Testing
 - Create a folder named test, and put some files malicious and otherwise in that folder
 - Run the transfer_binary_classifier.ipynb file, and notice how the model classifies the files with an associated confidence factor.
